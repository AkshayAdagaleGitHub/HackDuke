# HackDuke2018
* Application developed during the Duke Hackathon MLH - 2018 - INEQUALITY TRACK
* This project serves as the official submission for the HackDuke - 2018, developed during the second weekend of October (13 and 14).

# Easy Connect Platform
* This platform aims at connecting people from financially poor backgrounds, who can't afford smartphones and an internet connection and hence lose out on a lot opportunities that can help me them with odd jobs and handyman type work.
* A lot of these people are either exploited by middlemen, who charge a lot from the actual customer and give them only a little potion of this.
* Our initial motivation was mainly homeless people who end up in this situation and are stuck in it forever, because of lack of opportunities.
* We feel this platform can bridge the inequality gap and provide these people with opportunities that they otherwise miss on.
